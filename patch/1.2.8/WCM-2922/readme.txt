Summary

    * Status: The If-Modified-Since property in the HTTP header of all resources generated by REST service doesn't exist
    * CCP Issue: CCP-628, Product Jira Issue: WCM-2922.
    * Complexity: N/A

The Proposal
Problem description

What is the problem to fix?

    * If-Modified-Since property in the HTTP header is missing for resources generated with rest service(images/css,js..).
      This property must be set by default.

Fix description

How is the problem fixed?

    * Update the REST service to:
          o set Last-Modified property for HTTP response header for some resources in REST service
          o use Cache Control for some image resources (if cached resource has not been modified, return 304 code).

Tests to perform

Reproduction test
1- Start WCM 1.2.6
2- Go to Site Acme -> OverView

3-Use firebug addon (choose tab: Net/All) to view information of resources got from server (example: http://localhost:8080/portal/rest/images/repository/collaboration/399bab8d7f00000100b9f67ad86098b2?type=file)

=> if-modified-since property doesn't exist in HTTP header

Tests performed at DevLevel
  1. Do the same operations like reproduction test => HTTP header has the if-modified-since propert, status is 200 OK

  2. Refresh page, the status is changed to 304 Non Modified
